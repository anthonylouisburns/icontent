##IContent
IContent is intended to allow intuitive and simple generation of Technical and data intensive documents, particularly HTML.

The functionality largely reproduces what is possible with [NBViewer](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/). IContent attempts to make customization of the documents more transparent and excessable than with NBViewer.

IContent is most directly derived from [ipython/docker-notebook](https://github.com/ipython/docker-notebook)

IContent's functionality is modeled after static content generation frameworks like [Hugo](http://gohugo.io/), and inspired by the entire IPython community particularly those using IPython for blogging.

The core functionality is provide by [NBConvert](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/tree/master/IPython/nbconvert). IContent is a simple composition of a handful of individual [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) services, coordinated using [fig](http://www.fig.sh/).
