##IContent
This project takes direct inspiration from a number of impressive projects and countless fasinating blogs.

IContent is most directly derived from [ipython/docker-notebook](https://github.com/ipython/docker-notebook)

IContent's functionality is modeled after static content generation frameworks like [Hugo](http://gohugo.io/)

IContent is also and the entire IPython community particularly those using IPython for blogging.

The core functionality is provide by [NBConvert](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/tree/master/IPython/nbconvert) and is largely reproducing what [NBViewer](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/) in I hope a more transparent way.
